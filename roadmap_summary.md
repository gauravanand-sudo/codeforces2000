Got it — you want a **step-by-step 6-month roadmap** to reach **2000+ (Candidate Master) on Codeforces**. That’s ambitious but doable if you are consistent and strategic. I’ll break it down phase-wise.

# 🚀 6-Month Roadmap to 2000+ on Codeforces

## 🔹 Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation & Speed

**Goal:** Build accuracy in *Div2 A/B/C*, improve speed.

* **Practice**:

  * Solve 3–4 **Div2 A/B** problems daily (don’t overthink, learn standard tricks).
  * Start solving **Div2 C** (medium DP/greedy/constructive).
* **Focus Topics:**

  * Implementation, brute force, math, prefix/suffix, binary search, greedy.
* **Strategy:**

  * If you fail a problem in contest → upsolve it within 24 hrs.
  * Track mistakes in a notebook (silly mistakes, missing case, lack of technique).

---

## 🔹 Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Core Problem-Solving Muscle

**Goal:** Get consistent at solving **Div2 C/D** in contest.

* **Practice**:

  * 2 problems daily from **1500–1800 rating**.
  * Start **Div2 D** upsolving.
* **Focus Topics:**

  * DP (1D/2D), graph basics (DFS, BFS, shortest path), number theory (gcd, lcm, modular).
* **Strategy:**

  * Virtual contests: solve a past Div2 contest in real-time.
  * Begin training on AtCoder Beginner Contests (helps with implementation speed).

---

## 🔹 Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Advanced Patterns

**Goal:** Comfort with **1800–2000 level** problems.

* **Practice**:

  * 1–2 problems daily from **1800–2000 rating**.
  * Continue 1 Div2 contest per week (virtual or live).
* **Focus Topics:**

  * Advanced DP (digit DP, DP on subsets, state compression).
  * Graphs (toposort, bipartite, DSU, MST, shortest paths with weights).
  * Binary search on answer, constructive algorithms.
* **Strategy:**

  * Analyze editorials deeply → don’t just read, rewrite in your own words.
  * Implement from scratch next day without looking.

---

## 🔹 Phase 4 (Weeks 13–16): Contest Strategy & Stamina

**Goal:** Perform in **Div2 C/D/E** under pressure.

* **Practice**:

  * Do **2 full contests per week** (live or virtual).
  * Upsolve 100% of problems you couldn’t solve in time.
* **Focus Topics:**

  * Combinatorics, probability, FFT basics, segment tree, Fenwick tree.
* **Strategy:**

  * Learn when to skip in contest → don’t sink time on one problem.
  * Build template (fast I/O, modint, DSU, graph).

---

## 🔹 Phase 5 (Weeks 17–20): Hitting Candidate Master Level

**Goal:** Be able to solve **Div2 E** occasionally, 3–4 problems every contest.

* **Practice**:

  * 1 problem daily from **2000–2200 rating**.
  * Continue 2 contests per week.
* **Focus Topics:**

  * Harder data structures (segment tree variants, binary lifting, DSU on tree).
  * More constructive + ad-hoc problem practice.
* **Strategy:**

  * Focus on **fast reads & error-free coding** → small mistakes kill rating.
  * After each contest, write a “contest diary” (what went wrong, how to fix).

---

## 🔹 Phase 6 (Weeks 21–24): Rating Push

**Goal:** Reach **2000+**.

* **Practice**:

  * Alternate days → 1 hard problem (2000–2300) + 1 medium problem (1600–1800).
  * 2 contests per week, upsolve all.
* **Mindset:**

  * Don’t fear rating drops → focus on learning speed.
  * Trust your preparation, contests will align.

---

# 📌 Key Habits

* **Consistency > Intensity**: Even 2 hrs daily is enough if regular.
* **Upsolve everything**: Growth = learning from unsolved.
* **Track weak areas**: If you keep failing in DP/graphs, dedicate 1 extra week.
* **Discuss solutions**: Explaining to others (or writing blogs) helps you internalize.

---

# 🔧 Tools & Resources

* Codeforces Problemset Filter by rating.
* AtCoder (great for math + DP intuition).
* CP-Algorithms (cp-algorithms.com) → for theory & implementation.
* Errichto / SecondThread YouTube → contest editorials.

👉 If you follow this roadmap, in **6 months** you can consistently solve **3–4 problems in Div2** and touch **2000+**.

Do you want me to also create a **daily/weekly schedule (2 hrs/day)** so you can plug it directly into your routine?
